				<h3>Other titles:</h3>
				<p>Although most of our work is in the home and garden categories, HGES has produced titles in other areas, including sports and woodworking, as well as youth magazines.</p>

				<h2>Services</h2>

				<h3>Writing</h3>
				<p>Our published writers create clear, concise content for manuscripts, articles, newsletters, brochures, menus, direct-mail pieces, Web site content and whatever else you may need. If a writer with expertise in a certain subject is required, we’ll hire one if he or she isn’t already on staff.</p>

				<h3>Design</h3>
				<p>Our team of experienced designers and illustrators — all of them have experience working on books and at national magazines — will work with you to produce eye-popping projects, large or small.</p>

				<h3>Layout</h3>
				<p>Our designers are proficient in QuarkXPress and are committed to providing creative, pleasing printed materials. They can work from a template or create a new design, incorporating text, photos, illustrations, maps, charts, graphs and other elements.</p>

				<h3>Editing</h3>
				<p>Editing is much more than simply searching for misspelled words, and our editors, who have college degrees and years of related experience, handle the myriad tasks. Those tasks include copyediting (checking for spelling, grammar, punctuation and consistency in style), proofreading (reviewing hard copy for typographical and formatting errors), and fact checking.</p>

				<h3>Indexing</h3>
				<p>Is there anything more boring and more tedious than creating an index? Let us do the boring, tedious work for you. We create professional indexes in-house, taking great care in choosing the terms that will be listed — we don’t leave that job to a computer.</p>

				<h3>Photo Research</h3>
				<p>If your project requires photos, we’ll get them. Perhaps we already have what you need in stock. If we don’t have what you need, we go straight to the source, whether that’s a freelance photographer, a manufacturer, an organization or a stock photography agency.</p>

				<h3>Photography and Art</h3>
				<p>We have talented photographers and illustrators on staff if original photography or artwork is required. Our photographers can also handle prepress issues.</p>
